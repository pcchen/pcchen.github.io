## Syllabus
In this class we will learn computational physics techniques which can be used to study graduate level quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. We will use Python and Jupyter Lab/Notebook. We plan to cover following topics:

* Exact solution of 1D spin chain.
* Exact diagonization.
* Matrix product state and tensor network state algorithm.
  * DMRG/MPS algorithm.
  * Real/Imaginary time evolution via TEBD.
* Quantum phase transition.
* Finite-size scaling.
